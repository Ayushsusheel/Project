# Technical Knowledge Tester

# INTRODUCTION 

To modify the education system and gives students a break from traditional classroom learning, there is urgent need to revive the quiz culture in school and colleges.The ‘MCQ Quiz Application’ project will be developed to overcome the time consuming problem of manual system. A quiz is a quick and informal assessment of student knowledge. Quizzes are often used in higher education environments to briefly test a students’ level of comprehension regarding course material, providing teachers with insights into student progress and any existing knowledge gaps. By discovering of a new technology, it act as a facilitator by bringing innovation to quizzes and ensuring active participation among students. 

Quizzes redefine the education system in significant ways:-

a) Interactive Platform
Today, quizzes are interactive platforms where students are not participating to take home a prize, but to gain knowledge, seek opportunities to excel beyond academics and secure their future.

b)  Changes Scope of Learning
Since, questions are based out of syllabus and require critical thinking and extensive research, students get into habit of innovative learning from an early age.

c) Encourage Team Work
Students need to form team while participating in the quizzes, giving them an opportunity to sharpen their teamwork skills.

d) Bridges academic-industry gap
During the interview process, interviewer found that the candidates are good in theoretical knowledge but are not aware of industry knowledge. Hence, there is still huge gap of candidates to prepare them for industry.


The future of quizzing helps to transform learning for every students. There are many tools on various platform like SurveyMonkey, Typeform, Quizzlet etc. and just focus on the content. Quizzing is not about only GK, but connecting the dots, reading between lines and arriving the conclusion. It need to focus on logical reasoning too.

# Objective 
To organize Quiz Tester is to evaluate the knowledge of the participants within academics as well as beyond academics and to make them familiar with the prospects of quizzes and the objectivity of the questions. The main purpose of the testing the quiz is to develop interest in subject areas of every field including competitive aspects like GATE, CAT etc. 

The purpose of the project is to build an application to reduce the manual work for managing MCQ questions and by making this project, we will achieve this project:-

A) To create best platform for managing MCQ questions

The methodology of developing of project is the step by step sequence to design, develop and deliver the application. 

Following methodology steps will be followed in our project:-  

a) Requirement and Specification
 
In this, system store the information of the users, tests, questions and result. Users able to do many attempts and system should keep all records and display the results. System allow the administrator to delete and update questions dependent on it.

b) Project Design

In this, Front page opens with the title “Welcome to the Game” && “Become a Technical Geek”. After that users have given options, they have entered according to their choice:
1. Press S to start the game
2. Press V to view the highest score
3. Press R to reset score

After reading the rules, its user choice whether he/she wanna start the game by pressing Y else press any other key to return to the main menu.

c) Execution

In this part, we show the coding part and all its functions.

d) Testing

In this part, we test the code its executing properly or not and any other changes required.
